## Part 1 - Make these plots!

Making plots using the gampinder dataset.
Plot are made up of layers, just like ogres.

### Plot 1

```{r}
# load the libraries that I will be using
library(gapminder)
library(ggplot2)
```


```{r}
plot1 <- ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp,
                                      color = continent))
# Jillian, I made the backbone of the plot and wanted to color
## by continent
plot1 + geom_point()
# here I added a layer of the points
```

### Plot 2

```{r}
# log the shit out of the data
plot2 <- ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = log(gdpPercap), y = lifeExp,
                                      color = continent))
plot2 + geom_point()
# fuck yeah
```

### Plot 3

```{r}
plot3 <- ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = log(gdpPercap), y = lifeExp))
plot3 + geom_point(aes(color = continent)) + stat_smooth(method = 'lm')
# had to specify to do coloring by continent in geom_point
# if I kept it within the original ggplot() there would be a stat_smooth
## line for every continent individiually
```

### Plot 4

```{r}
plot4 <- ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = lifeExp, fill = continent ))
plot4 + geom_density(aes(alpha = .3)) + facet_wrap(~ year)
# fill = continent in the ggplot() otherwise can't get black outline
## from geom_density
```


### Plot 5

```{r}
plot5 <- ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp,
                                      color = continent))
plot5 + geom_boxplot() + facet_wrap(~ year)
```




### Plot 6 - ish
```{r}
plot6 <- ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = lifeExp, fill = continent ))
plot6 + geom_density(aes(alpha = .3))
```

### Plot 7

```{r}

```


### Plot 8

```{r}

```


## Part 3 - Find the mistakes

```{r}
setwd('~/R_Projects/PCinR/Homework_Lynum')
hw_gapminder <- read.csv('hw_gapminder.csv')
```

```{r}
mean_lifeExp <- mean(hw_gapminder$lifeExp)
# want to find the mean of all life expectancy
mean_lifeExp
# Jillian, you spelled lifeExp wrong. 
```


```{r}
small_set <- hw_gapminder[c(1, 2, 3, 4, 1300:1305),
c('country', 'continent', 'year')]
small_set
# You foroget the c before the country, continent, year
```


```{r}
mean_gdp <- mean(hw_gapminder$gdpPercap, na.rm = T)
# I want to find the mean of the gdpPercap of all the data
mean_gdp
# You sneakily put in NAs. You jerk.
```

```{r}
max_country <- hw_gapminder$country[which(hw_gapminder$lifeExp == 
                                            max(hw_gapminder$lifeExp))]
max_country
# You have to use double equals (==)
```
